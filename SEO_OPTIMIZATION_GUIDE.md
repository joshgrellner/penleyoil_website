## üöÄ QUICK WINS (Add These Now)

### 1. **Google Business Profile** (CRITICAL - Do This First!)

**Why:** This is THE #1 ranking factor for local searches like "diesel delivery near me" or "fuel delivery Oklahoma City"

**Setup Steps:**
1. Go to https://business.google.com
2. Claim your listing for "Penley Oil Company"
3. Verify your business (Google will mail a postcard to 2627 W. Reno Ave)
4. Complete 100% of your profile:
   - Business hours (Mon-Thu 7AM-4:30PM, Fri 7AM-4PM)
   - Phone: (405) 235-7553
   - Website: https://penleyoil.com
   - Categories:
     - Fuel Supplier (Primary)
     - Diesel Fuel Supplier
     - Oil & Gas Exploration Service
     - Lubricant Supplier
   - Service areas: Add Oklahoma City, Edmond, Norman, Moore, Yukon, etc.

   - Upload photos:
     - Logo

     - Facility at 2627 W. Reno Ave
     - Team photos
     - DEF storage tanks

5. **Get Reviews:**
   - Ask satisfied customers to leave Google reviews
   - Target: 20+ reviews with 4.5+ star average
   - Respond to every review (positive or negative)

**Impact:** This alone can 10x your local search visibility

---

### 2. **Add Image Alt Text** (30 minutes)

**Why:** Google can't "see" images without alt text. Alt text helps with image search and accessibility.

**Current Status:** Some images have alt text, but many are missing descriptive keywords.

**What to Add:**
```tsx
// Homepage hero
<Image
  src="/hero-truck.png"
  alt="Penley Oil diesel fuel delivery truck in Oklahoma City"
  ...
/>

// Service icons/images
<Image
  src="/fuel-icon.png"
  alt="Diesel fuel delivery service icon - same-day delivery Oklahoma"
  ...
/>

// DEF page
<Image
  src="/def-tank.png"
  alt="20,000 gallon DEF storage tanks at Penley Oil facility Oklahoma City"
  ...
/>
```

**Formula for good alt text:**
- Describe what's in the image
- Include 1-2 relevant keywords naturally
- Keep it under 125 characters

---

### 3. **Optimize Page Load Speed**

**Current:** Already fast with Next.js, but you can go further:

Add to `next.config.js`:
```js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
    minimumCacheTTL: 31536000,
  },
  compress: true,
}
```

**Test your speed:**
- https://pagespeed.web.dev/
- Target: 90+ score on mobile and desktop

---

### 4. **Add More FAQ Schema to Service Pages**

**Why:** FAQ rich snippets take up huge space in search results and boost click-through rates.

**Example for `/fuel-delivery` page:**
```typescript
const fuelFAQs = [
  {
    question: 'How much does diesel fuel delivery cost in Oklahoma City?',
    answer: 'Diesel delivery pricing depends on volume and location. Deliveries start at 100 gallons. Contact us at (405) 235-7553 for a custom quote based on your needs.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you deliver diesel fuel on weekends?',
    answer: 'Yes, weekend diesel delivery is available upon request in Oklahoma City and surrounding areas. Call (405) 235-7553 to schedule weekend fueling.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What types of diesel fuel do you deliver?',
    answer: 'We deliver both on-road (clear) diesel and off-road (dyed) diesel. On-road diesel is for highway vehicles, while dyed diesel is tax-exempt for construction equipment, agriculture, and generators.'
  }
];
```

Add similar FAQs to:
- `/def` (5-7 DEF-specific questions)
- `/lubricants` (3-5 questions)
- `/tanks` (3-5 questions about tank rentals)
