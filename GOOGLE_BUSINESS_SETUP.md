# Google Business Profile Setup Guide
## Penley Oil Company

**Priority: CRITICAL** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Time Required: 30 minutes setup + 5-7 days for verification**
**Impact: 10x increase in local search visibility**

---

## Why This Matters

Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) is THE #1 factor for local search rankings. When people search:
- "diesel delivery near me"
- "fuel delivery Oklahoma City"
- "DEF supplier near me"

...Google shows the **Local Pack** (map with 3 businesses) ABOVE organic search results. Being in that top 3 = huge visibility.

**Without a claimed Google Business Profile, you're invisible for local searches.**
