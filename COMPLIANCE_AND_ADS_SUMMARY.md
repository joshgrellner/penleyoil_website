## 💡 Tips for Data Collection

### Google Ads
- Search both "Penley Oil" AND "penleyoil.com" (may return different results)
- Set date range to "All time" to see historical ads
- Take screenshots even if you can't download the creative
- Note any ad extensions (call, sitelink, location, etc.)

### Meta Ads
- Switch from "Active" to "All ads" to see paused/ended ads
- Download video ads if possible (or screen record)
- Copy the primary text, headline, AND description (all are separate fields)
- Note which platforms each ad runs on (Facebook Feed, Instagram Story, etc.)

### Microsoft Ads
- If the public library has no results, that's OK
- Note this gap and request export from Thryv
- Microsoft's transparency is more limited than Google/Meta

### General
- Use descriptive filenames: `google-ad-001-diesel-delivery.png`
- Copy the transparency center URL for each ad (source_link column)
- If unsure about a field, leave it blank rather than guessing
- Run `node scripts/audit-ads.mjs` frequently to catch issues early
